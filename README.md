Dopamine DAO is a Nouns DAO fork modified to support "drops" of Dopamine tabs, ERC-721 NFTs with non-generative psychadelic art that act as the membership token to the Dopamine metaverse.

## Components

Dopamine contracts are currently divided into four components: Governance, ERC721, Auctions, and NFTs.
